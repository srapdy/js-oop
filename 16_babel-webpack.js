// Babel is a transpiler (translator + compiler) a.k.a. source-to-source compiler or compile-to-Js in javascript.
// Coffeescript and typescript are also transpilers.
// Babel translates modern javascript code to ES5 standard that is compatible with most browsers

// Webpack is used to bundle a lot of javascript files into a single javascript file for transport
// It also uglifies the code i.e, removes whitepsaces, renames variables to shorter names etc
// Webpack also internally installs babels and executes it so we don't have to manage babel manually

// Both Babel and Webpack are used for front-end javascript development and are installed using
// npm package manager
